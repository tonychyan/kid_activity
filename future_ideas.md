# Future Ideas for Kid Activity App

## Instagram Integration for New Activity Sources

### Current Challenge
The app currently relies on screenshots from parents as the primary activity source. While reliable, expanding to new sources like Instagram accounts that post activity recommendations could increase coverage. These Instagram sources typically provide:
- Basic activity names
- Dates and times
- Instagram handles for venues/organizers (@mentions)
- Limited details about the actual events

### Integration Approaches

#### 1. Data Extraction Options
- **Direct Instagram API**
  - Use Instagram Graph API for reliable programmatic access
  - Requires developer account and authentication
  - More structured but has rate limits and requires app approval
  
- **Enhanced Screenshot Processing**
  - Continue using screenshots but with specialized Instagram format detection
  - Create dedicated parser for Instagram-style posts
  - Lower technical barrier but less reliable

#### 2. Completing Missing Information
Instagram posts lack complete information needed by the app:

- **Handle-to-Location Database**
  - Create and maintain a mapping between Instagram handles and physical locations
  - Include address data, venue details, website links
  - Could be manually built initially, then automated

- **Web Enrichment**
  - Use web scraping to fetch additional details from organizations' websites
  - Fill in missing descriptions, age ranges, costs, registration info
  - Automate retrieval of location information from linked websites

#### 3. Implementation Phases

- **Phase 1: Manual Integration**
  - Build initial Instagram handle â†’ location database manually
  - Use specialized prompts when processing Instagram screenshots
  - Human verification of enriched data

- **Phase 2: Semi-Automated Solution**
  - Automate Instagram format detection
  - Implement handle lookup and enrichment logic
  - Improve database as new handles are encountered

- **Phase 3: Fully Automated Solution**
  - Direct Instagram API integration
  - Automated website scraping for latest details
  - Feedback mechanism to improve location data over time

### Key Components Needed

1. **Instagram Format Detector**: Code to recognize the special format of Instagram activity posts
2. **Handle-to-Location Database**: Mapping Instagram handles to physical locations
3. **Specialized Parser**: LLM prompt or code to extract structured data from Instagram format
4. **Enrichment System**: Logic to complete partial information with database and web lookups

### Expected Results
This enhancement would significantly increase the number of activities available in the app while maintaining data quality through the enrichment process.

## Web Scraping Integration: do512family.com

### Opportunity
Two promising web sources have been identified for activity data:

1. **https://do512family.com/this-weekend/**
   - Curated list with a small number of high-quality weekend activities
   - Information is presented in an article format
   - Contains images, descriptions, and basic details
   
2. **https://family.do512.com/**
   - Comprehensive calendar interface with many activities
   - Requires clicking into individual events to get complete information
   - More structured data organization

### Integration Approaches

#### 1. Weekend List Scraping (do512family.com/this-weekend)
- **Scheduled Scraping**
  - Automated weekly scraping of the weekend page
  - Parse article content to extract activity details
  - Relatively simple implementation for high-quality activity data

- **Event Extraction**
  - Use web scraper to extract paragraphs about each event
  - Apply NLP/LLM to parse unstructured text into structured activity data
  - Extract dates, times, locations, and descriptions

#### 2. Calendar API Integration (family.do512.com)
- **Calendar Data Mining**
  - Analyze the website to identify any public APIs or endpoints
  - Create crawler to navigate calendar interface and collect event URLs
  - Implement parallel scraping of individual event pages

- **Deep Data Extraction**
  - Build dedicated parser for event detail pages
  - Extract comprehensive information (times, locations, age ranges, costs)
  - Store data in app-compatible format

### Implementation Considerations

- **Request Rate Limiting**
  - Implement ethical scraping practices with appropriate delays
  - Honor robots.txt directives and terms of service
  - Consider caching to minimize repeat requests

- **Data Transformation Pipeline**
  - Convert scraped HTML to structured activity data
  - Normalize location information for map integration
  - Standardize date/time formats to match app requirements

- **Maintenance Strategy**
  - Monitor for website layout changes that could break scrapers
  - Schedule regular validation checks to ensure data quality
  - Implement alerts for scraping failures

### Implementation Phases

- **Phase 1: Basic Weekend List Scraping**
  - Create simple scraper for do512family.com/this-weekend
  - Implement parsing of basic event details
  - Manual verification and integration with app data

- **Phase 2: Calendar Integration**
  - Develop crawler for family.do512.com calendar
  - Build event detail page parser
  - Create pipeline for systematic data extraction

- **Phase 3: Automated System**
  - Schedule regular scraping jobs
  - Implement validation and error handling
  - Create admin interface for monitoring scraping operations

### Expected Benefits
- More comprehensive activity coverage
- Regular influx of new activities with minimal manual effort
- Access to highly curated, local activity recommendations
